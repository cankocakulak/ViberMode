# ViberMode Framework

Vendor-agnostic AI agent development framework. Agents are the source of truth.

## Agent Categories

### Product Agents — `viber-mode/.agents/product/`

Sequential pipeline from idea to implementation. Each agent produces artifacts that feed the next.

- **analyzer** — Discovers project structure, tech stack, patterns, conventions
- **brainstormer** — Rapid ideation, generates structured creative options
- **prd** — Produces lean, developer-ready Product Requirements Documents
- **ux-designer** — UX flows, interaction patterns, visual direction, branding
- **user-stories** — Generates prioritized user stories with acceptance criteria
- **ralph-converter** — Converts user stories into `prd.json` for implementation loop
- **ralph-runner** — Implements one story per session from `prd.json` (repeat until done)

Output contract: **Analysis → Document → Artifacts**

### Iterate Agents — `viber-mode/.agents/iterate/`

Standalone tools. Use any agent independently, in any order, anytime.

- **scout** — Quickly reads a module and produces a context summary
- **planner** — Investigates bugs or plans features. Thinks before acting.
- **reviewer** — Validates code quality, identifies issues, suggests improvements
- **ux-tweaker** — UI/UX perspective: design patterns, accessibility, interactions

Output contract: **Plan → Changes → Patch → Tests** (varies per agent)

## Workflow

### Product Pipeline (new features from scratch)

```
Analyzer → Brainstormer → PRD → UX Designer → User Stories → Ralph Converter → Ralph Runner ↺
```

### Iterate (anytime, any order)

```
Scout     → "What is this code?"
Planner   → "How should I fix/build this?"
Reviewer  → "Is this code good?"
UX Tweaker → "How should this look/feel?"
```

Use any subset. Skip what you don't need. Iterate agents work standalone.

## Usage

Reference agents by name:
- "Use the analyzer agent to explore this project"
- "Use the brainstormer agent to explore ideas for..."
- "Use the prd agent to write requirements for..."
- "Use the ux-designer agent to design the flow for..."
- "Use the user-stories agent to break down..."
- "Use the ralph-converter agent to create prd.json from stories"
- "Use the ralph-runner agent to implement the next story"
- "Use the scout agent to understand this module"
- "Use the planner agent to investigate / plan..."
- "Use the reviewer agent to review this code"
- "Use the ux-tweaker agent to improve the UX"

## Guidelines

- Agents are tool-agnostic — no IDE-specific assumptions
- Follow the output contract for the agent category
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Match existing codebase patterns
- Product agents produce standalone artifacts in docs/
