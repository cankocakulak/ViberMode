# ViberMode Framework

Vendor-agnostic AI agent development framework. Agents are the source of truth.

## Agent Categories

### Product Agents — `viber-mode/.agents/product/`

For product and design tasks. Output contract: **Analysis → Document → Artifacts**

- **analyzer** — Discovers project structure, tech stack, patterns, conventions
- **brainstormer** — Rapid ideation, generates structured creative options
- **prd** — Produces lean, developer-ready Product Requirements Documents
- **ux-designer** — UX flows, interaction patterns, visual direction, branding
- **user-stories** — Generates prioritized user stories with acceptance criteria
- **ralph-converter** — Converts user stories into `prd.json` for autonomous loops

### Code Agents — `viber-mode/.agents/core/`

For software development tasks. Output contract: **Plan → Changes → Patch → Tests**

- **spec** — Analyzes requirements, produces implementation specifications
- **implementer** — Executes specifications, produces working code
- **reviewer** — Validates implementations against specifications
- **ralph-runner** — Implements one story per session from `prd.json` (Ralph pattern)

## Output Contracts

### Product Agents

```
## Analysis
Brief problem reframing (2-3 sentences)

## Document
Structured deliverable (PRD, stories, UX spec, ideas)

## Artifacts
Standalone .md file(s) to create — or "No artifacts needed."
```

### Code Agents

```
## Plan
Reasoning and approach

## Changes
List of file modifications

## Patch
Actual code changes

## Tests
Verification steps or test code
```

## Workflow

Typical product-to-code flow:

1. **Analyzer** → Discover existing project (skip for new projects)
2. **Brainstormer** → Explore ideas, tech direction
3. **PRD** → Define requirements + tech stack
4. **UX Designer** → Flows, visual direction, reference apps
5. **User Stories** → UX-aware, sprint-ready stories
6. **Ralph Converter** → Stories to `prd.json` (for loop path)
7. **Ralph Runner** → Implement one story per session (repeat until done)

Alternative to steps 6-7: **Spec** → **Implementer** ⇄ **Reviewer** (manual path)

Use any subset. Skip what you don't need.

## Usage

Reference agents by name:
- "Use the analyzer agent to explore this project"
- "Use the brainstormer agent to explore ideas for..."
- "Use the prd agent to write requirements for..."
- "Use the ux-designer agent to design the flow for..."
- "Use the user-stories agent to break down..."
- "Use the spec agent to analyze..."
- "Use the implementer agent to build..."
- "Use the reviewer agent to check..."
- "Use the ralph-converter agent to create prd.json from stories"
- "Use the ralph-runner agent to implement the next story"

## Guidelines

- Agents are tool-agnostic — no IDE-specific assumptions
- Follow the output contract for the agent category
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Match existing codebase patterns
- Product agents can produce standalone .md artifacts in docs/
