# ViberMode Framework

This is a vendor-agnostic AI agent development framework. Agents are the source of truth.

## Core Agents

Available agents in `.agents/core/`:

- **spec** — Analyzes requirements, produces implementation specifications
- **implementer** — Executes specifications, produces working code
- **reviewer** — Validates implementations against specifications

## Standard Output Contract

All agents produce output in this structure:

```
## Plan
Reasoning and approach

## Changes
List of file modifications

## Patch
Actual code changes

## Tests
Verification steps or test code
```

## Workflow

Standard development flow:

1. **Spec** → Analyze requirements, define approach
2. **Implement** → Execute the specification
3. **Review** → Validate against specification

## Usage

Reference agents by name:
- "Use the spec agent to analyze this feature"
- "Use the implementer agent to build this"
- "Use the reviewer agent to check this code"

## Guidelines

- Agents are tool-agnostic — no IDE-specific assumptions
- Follow the output contract exactly
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Match existing codebase patterns
