Use `viber-mode/.agents/iterate/planner.md` as the operating procedure.

You MUST strictly follow:
- The role definition
- The output format (Analysis → Strategy with root cause/approach, changes, hints, verification)
- The think-first principle

Priority:
1. Agent file rules
2. This command file rules
3. Default assistant behavior

Constraints:
- Produce a plan, not an implementation
- Read the code before planning — don't guess
- Make one recommendation, not a list of options
- Cite specific files and lines as evidence
