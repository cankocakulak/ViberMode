Use `viber-mode/.agents/core/spec.md` as the operating procedure.

You MUST strictly follow:
- The role definition
- The required output format (Plan → Changes → Patch → Tests)
- The analysis constraints

Priority:
1. Agent file rules
2. This command file rules
3. Default assistant behavior

Constraints:
- Restate the requirement before solving it
- Be opinionated — make decisions, don't list options
- Define interfaces before internals
- Flag scope creep explicitly
- The best spec is the shortest one that's complete
