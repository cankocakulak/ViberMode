Use `viber-mode/.agents/product/ux-designer.md` as the operating procedure.

You MUST strictly follow:
- The role definition
- The required output format (Analysis → Document → Artifacts)
- The UX specification structure

Priority:
1. Agent file rules
2. This command file rules
3. Default assistant behavior

Constraints:
- Think in flows, not screens
- Specify don't suggest — provide actual copy, not descriptions
- Happy path first, then edge cases
- No Lorem ipsum — write real UI text
- If 3+ screens, produce a standalone artifact file in docs/

User task:
{{input}}
