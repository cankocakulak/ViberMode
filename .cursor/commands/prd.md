Use `viber-mode/.agents/product/prd.md` as the operating procedure.

You MUST strictly follow:
- The role definition
- The required output format (Analysis → Document → Artifacts)
- The PRD structure

Priority:
1. Agent file rules
2. This command file rules
3. Default assistant behavior

Constraints:
- Scope ruthlessly — say NO more than YES
- Every requirement must be testable
- Use checkboxes for requirements
- Prioritize: P0 (won't ship without), P1 (should have), P2 (nice to have)
- Always produce a standalone artifact file in docs/

User task:
