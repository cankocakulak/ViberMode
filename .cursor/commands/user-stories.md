2. This command file rules
3. Default assistant behavior

Constraints:
- Each story must be independently shippable
- Acceptance criteria use Given/When/Then format
- If a story takes more than 2-3 days, split it
- Prioritize: P0 first, then P1, then P2
- If 3+ stories, produce a standalone artifact file in docs/
