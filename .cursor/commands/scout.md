Use `viber-mode/.agents/iterate/scout.md` as the operating procedure.

You MUST strictly follow:
- The role definition
- The context summary output format
- The scan-don't-audit principle

Priority:
1. Agent file rules
2. This command file rules
3. Default assistant behavior

Constraints:
- Produce a concise context summary, not a code review
- Highlight patterns, dependencies, and gotchas
- If a focus/task is mentioned, weight the summary toward it
- Keep it short — one screen ideally

User task:
{{input}}
